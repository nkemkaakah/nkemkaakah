## 🏆 Hackathon Experience  
In **April**, I participated in a high-energy hackathon (hosted by Langflow, Twilio & TurinTech) where I led the development of a multi-agent AI project.  
- Role: Full stack lead — designed the architecture, built key backend services and integrated LLMs + automation.  
- Tech stack included Node.js, MongoDB, Langflow workflows, Twilio for communications.  
- Outcome: Built a solution prototype, pitched to judges and engaged with fellow founders/engineers — built connections and gained real-world product experience under pressure.
