## 🚀 What I Do  
I combine deep technical skills with a product-mindset to deliver meaningful software:  
- Backend systems using **Node.js**, **FastAPI (Python)** and **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**  
- Front-end development with **React**, **Next.js**, and modern UI frameworks  
- Building and deploying **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures**, multi-agent AI systems and automation pipelines  
- Designing services for clients and internal users alike: whether it’s a startup needing its first MVP or a business upgrading its digital product

## 🎯 Projects & Experience Highlights  
Here are some of the key projects I’ve worked on:

### 🧠 Key Projects 
- **🩺 Hackathon – AI Voice Bot for Child Healthcare (Hackathon Project)** — Designed an **AI-powered voice assistant** using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Langflow**, and **ElevenLabs**, enabling friendly health interactions for children. Containerised with **Docker** and deployed on a **VPS**, delivering real-time voice-to-action workflows.  

- **🛡️ VoxGuard – AI Voice Fraud Detection Platform** — Built a real-time fraud detection system processing 200+ voice segments per minute with **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **WebSockets**. Integrated biometric and behavioral analytics to detect deepfakes with **82% accuracy**, strengthening trust and compliance in voice-based customer interactions.  

- **🏙️ ZenFinder – Intelligent Property Insight Engine** — Developed scalable **Python** and **React** pipelines that turned fragmented property datasets into actionable insights. Fine-tuned **RAG-based AI models** and optimized automation workflows, cutting decision latency by **50%** for analysts.  

- **💼 Freelance / Client Work** — Delivered **custom websites and apps** for startups, small businesses, and ministries, including brands like **Zenstrin**, **Gutzfit**, and **IwemiResearch**, focusing on automation, analytics, and responsive design.

## 🏆 Hackathon Experience  
In **April**, I participated in a high-energy hackathon (hosted by Langflow, Twilio & TurinTech) where I led the development of a multi-agent AI project.  
- Role: Full stack lead — designed the architecture, built key backend services and integrated LLMs + automation.  
- Tech stack included Node.js, MongoDB, Langflow workflows, Twilio for communications.  
- Outcome: Built a solution prototype, pitched to judges and engaged with fellow founders/engineers — built connections and gained real-world product experience under pressure.
